# hfg-Education
Hyperledger education and training material forked from hyperledgre/education.

With this fork, I want to make also code in go(lang). Doing that does not mean that I don't like javascript, but try to understand what makes people choose javascript (fabric-sdk-node) over go(lang) (fabric-sdk-go)?
